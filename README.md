# servo-webusb


I created an Arduino UNO script that makes the servo motor move in a cycle.
I also built an HTML interface on GitHub that allows me to control the servo freely.

With this interface, I can:

Start or stop the servo cycle

Stop the servo at any moment

Control the servo position manually
